We attempted to reproduce the results in the original paper using the soruce code linked but could not get it to run as there were missing functions in the package. We emailed the original author but have yet to receive a reply. As a backup plan we decided to use Professor Jeff Fessler's NUFFT implementation in his Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT), which performs min-max interpolation using a Kaiser-Bessel kernel. As preliminary experiments, we retrospectively undersampled non-cartesian k-space data generated by taking the Fourier transform of Matlab's built-in 'mristack' dataset. We tested MIRT's NUFFT on radial and spiral sampled data, which produced images with aliasing artifacts similar to when naively reconstructing via zero-insertion and IFFT. We believe that these results makes sense as the purpose of NUFFT is to reconstruct a cartesian image from non-cartesian k-space data, thus it should have little to no improvement in image quality when applied on undersampled data. That being said, there is perhaps a better need for defining fully-sampled vs undersampled data in non-cartesian sampling schemes...
