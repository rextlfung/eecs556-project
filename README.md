This repo contains the code for group three's project: Methods for Non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction.
- The NUFFT_MOLS directory contains the reference paper's code for the MOLS and WOLS NUFFT implementations.
- The Masks directory contain the Matlab functions for creating pseudo non-Cartesian radial and spiral sampling masks.
- example_nufft_mristack.m is the script for reconstructing mristack brain images.
- example_nufft_MOLS_data.m is the script for reconstructing the knee image from the reference paper.
